HangupsDroid is a port of [hangups](https://hangups.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to Android.

It allows you to use Hangouts on an Android phone without Play Services.

## 2-Step Verification

hangups only supports the following 2FA methods:

* OTP (Google Authenticator)
* SMS

If none of these methods are available for your account, login will fail with `GoogleAuthError: Authorization code cookie not found`.

## Warning

Never give your Google account credentials to any application or device that you donâ€™t trust. Logging into Google grants hangups unrestricted access to your account. hangups works this way because Google does not provide any other method to access the Hangouts API.
